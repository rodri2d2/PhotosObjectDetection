This app downloads random pics from Loren Picsum, evaluate them and recognise based on Yolov3 trained objects


## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create an app to access a remote server and simply show the list on the screen.
Per each shown photo the system can evaluate and recognise objects inside them. Also the user can search for a specific type of photo from this list, if there are any, on detail the system will  draw a "recognised area" surrounding the object and label it.

```
Actually, the main goal is:
- To apply MVVM architecture correctly.
- Create a Network layer that is easy to implement and expand it if is needed.
- Work with CoreML and ML Models and Vision Framework.
```
